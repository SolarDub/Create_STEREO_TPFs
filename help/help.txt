ReadStarFile.sh HELP FILE
*************************


To execute:

    ./ReadStarFile.sh [--help] [--ohelp] [-d] [-f]

Description:

    --help	Prints this help file

    --ohelp	Lists the STEREO orbits by number.
		Each new orbit starts as the center of the HI-1A passes by 0h RA.

    Both the above will quit execution on printing their respective help files.
    After entering the data relevant to the selection of the switches below,
    execution of the program will commence

    -d		Prompts user to change directory paths.

		First path is to this script to be verified by the user.
		This is necessary to establish a path to the directory/URL text file.
		
		Second path is to the base STEREO HI1A data directory.
		It's default is of the form ##/##/stereo/h1a
                This contains the HI-1A image FITS files contructed by
                year -> month -> day.

		Third path is to the base STEREO stellar target pixel file data directory.
		It's default is of the form ##/##/stereo/StellarData
                This will contain the target pixel FITS files created by the program
                for a selected star and will place the files into a directory named with
                the star as listed in the input star list file (see below).

    -f		Prompts user to change the input star list file.

		This is the base path to the STEREO HI1A data.
		
		Default: 

		https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/ins_data/secchi_hi/L2/a/img/hi_1
