ReadStarFile.sh HELP FILE
*************************


To execute:

    ./ReadStarFile.sh [--help] [--ohelp] [-c] [-d] [-f] [-s]

Description:

    --help	Prints this help file

    --ohelp	Lists the STEREO orbits by number.
		Each new orbit starts as the center of the HI-1A field-of-view passes 0h RA.

    Both the above will quit execution on printing their respective text.


    default	With no switches, the program will obtain the existing directory and input file information.
		It will access the star names from the star list file.
		It will in turn obtain coordintes for these stars from SIMBAD.


    After entering the data relevant to the selection of the switches below,
    execution of the program will commence.


    -c		Read coordinates from supplied star list text file.

		With this switch, the program will access a text file to read a list of star names and coordinates.
		The user should ensure this text file will be accessed using the -f switch.

		Without this switch, the program will read a text file containing a list of star names.
		A Python script will be executed to determine the star's coordinates from SIMBAD.
		Again, the user should ensure the correct text file will be accessed by using the -f switch.


    -d		Prompts user to change directory paths.

		First path is to this script to be verified by the user.
		This is necessary to establish a path to the directory/URL text file.
		
		Second path is to the base STEREO HI1A data directory.
		Its default is of the form ##/##/stereo/h1a
                This contains the HI-1A image FITS files contructed by
                year -> month -> day.

		Third path is to the base STEREO stellar target pixel file data directory.
		Its default is of the form ##/##/stereo/StellarData
                This will contain the target pixel FITS files created by the program
                for a selected star and will place the files into a directory named with
                the star as listed in the input star list file (see below).


    -f		Prompts user to change the input star list file.

		This is the base path to the STEREO HI1A data.
		
		Default: 

		https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/ins_data/secchi_hi/L2/a/img/hi_1


    -s		Enter single star name into prompt.

		The program will use this star name and obtain its coordinates from SIMBAD.
		Spaces should be used where necessary. (12Sgr is ok, but DX Aqr, not DXAqr).
		The star name will be passed to the main program without spaces (i.e. DXAqr).
